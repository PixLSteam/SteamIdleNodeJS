# Pull requests

- Please follow this code style:
	- Tabs for indentation
	- camelCase for variable and function names (I also don't always do that, but I want it to be as consistent as possible)
	- Openening braces on the same line as the head/statement (if/else, loops, functions)
- Try not to break anything
- Explain what your change does
